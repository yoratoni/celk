Summary
-------
Introduction from the [Private Keys Database](https://privatekeys.pw/puzzles/bitcoin-puzzle-tx):
> In 2015, in order to show the hugeness of the private key space (or maybe just for fun), someone created a "puzzle" where he chose keys in a certain smaller space and sent increasing amounts to each of those keys.


As mentioned in the [Private Keys Database](https://privatekeys.pw/puzzles/bitcoin-puzzle-tx), I will focus on the puzzle #66,
which is the following:
- Address: `13zb1hQbWVsc2S7ZTZnP2G4undNNpdh5so`.
- Private key range: `20000000000000000:3ffffffffffffffff` (2^65 -> 2^66-1).
- Balance / Price: `6.60036213 BTC`.
